Team M&M: Md Abedin, Yiduo Ke

Description:

We want to make Othello the board game that allows two players on different computers to play against each other. There will be a chat feature to let users send messages to
each other while playing. There will also be a replay feature which saves game info in files that allows for exact reenactment of matches after they complete.

Interface:

To start, there will be a menu where a user can create a match, join an existing one, or play a replay file. The game will be played in the terminal, and the players can use arrow
keys to navigate the board and press enter when they've found a spot to place their piece. You can press c to enter the chat mode to send messages back and forth with your
opponent. The game screen will have the 8x8 board in the middle, match info on the top, and the chat log on the bottom.

Technical design:

	Topics covered in class:
	- We will allocate memory for arrays and buffers for reading & writing
	- We will store the board in a text file and interact with the pieces by writing to it
	- We will store the players' chat in another text file
	- We will find information from this text file when we save games and let the system reenact the match
	- We will use stat on replay files to determine when games were played
	- Forks and pipes to serve many games with 2 players per match
	- Signal handlers to handle rage quitting
	- Semaphores to control players writing to the chat file
	- Networking to let server handle the 2 players on different computers, and to play multiple games at once

	Breaking down tasks
	Md - converting between the 2D array and the board, creating the network, making chat
	client
	Yiduo - taking user input, developing algorithms, implementing the replay system

	Data structures
	We will use a 2D array for the board. This array, along with the pieces within it,  will be
	converted to a more human-friendly form and written into the board text file.

	Algorithms
	We will make an algorithm to determine the color switches that happen when a user
	places a piece, what places are legal to place pieces, and when the game is won
